Ronalda was a beautiful black cat with green eyes. She loved to play and explore, and she was always the first to find the best hiding spots. Her family loved her dearly and she was always the center of attention.

One day, Ronalda went exploring a little too far and got lost. She searched and searched for a way back home, but she couldn't find her way. She was getting tired and hungry, and she wasn't sure what to do.

Finally, Ronalda came across a kind-looking woman who helped her find her way home.
